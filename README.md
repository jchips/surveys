# Surveys

**Get insights, the easy way!**

Meet **Surveys** — the fun, easy-to-use iOS and Android app that lets you create and share surveys on anything you’re curious about.

> Whether you’re collecting opinions, brainstorming ideas, or just having fun, Surveys makes it simple.

Other app users can answer your surveys using multiple choice or text, and they can stay anonymous if they want to.

**Why choose Surveys?**

You get instant results, with clear pie charts to help you see what people think at a glance.

## Architecture

This project is built with React Native using Expo. The language used is JavaScript.

The backend for this project is [here](https://github.com/Jchips/surveys-api). It uses Nodejs, Express, MySQL or PostgreSql (either is supported), JWT, and Sequelize.

*to switch to using PostgreSQL, search for 'PostgreSQL' throughout all files and then follow directions from the comments for each result that shows up. Currently using a MySQL db.
